Welcome to the 3D modeling course repository. If you're looking for the course itself then check out [this page](https://sajmon170.github.io/modeling-course/) instead.

## Contribution guidelines
- Only use assets which are in the public domain and do not require attribution (a good source for them is [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). If you find any assets which violate this open an issue and replace them.
- Do not use gendered language since we do not know who exactly is going to read this course. Either refer to the reader directly (you) or use plural forms (users often... we can...) to refer to multiple readers at once.
- Always give examples (pictures or videos) to complex concepts.
- All videos should be encoded as VP9 `.webm` files with Opus audio for maximum compatibility

## Technical details
This project uses MkDocs along with the Material for MkDocs theme to generate the final HTML output. The website is deployed onto the `gh-pages` branch using `mkdocs gh-deploy`.
